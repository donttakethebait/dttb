for my own safety i intentionally am writing in bad grammar but in the name of research my methods and results are public and reproduceble
it is outrageous to witness the stripping of society peacefulness or respect of political difference
the aim here is to make simpler the identification of bot accounts and those traits common to opinion extremists
social media is being weaponized
don't take the bait

tools:
twint
? something for sentiment

rules:
don't gaslight me.
(i am not crazy. i am intentionally anonymous. also don't make fun of my typos. i will not dox anything except twtiter handle. be respectful. i will not stop my effort to id bad actors. move along now if you don't like what you see!!)

method:
1 point if a user
...over  1 K following AND over 1 K follower-but both under 200k, OR: <40 of both + less than 100 tweet count
...f\f ratio is between 0.60 and 1.67  but only if f & f are over 500
...f\f ratio is between 0.91 and 1.10 (extra points!!)  but only if f & f are over 2000
...rt\regular tweet ratio is 49\1
...inactivity block of eight monthes
...this one's complicated. if a high-score user [probable bot] have fewer than 40 percent "outsiders" (one with at least 50 links to someone else in list) TWO bonus for ALL INSIDERS
...[#]maga, ccot,, case insensitive. btw if some user is marked real high as a bot THEY get there bio added to a corpus used to id common hashtags \descriptors \ mention, its actually not fair to target only usa republican words because often bot accounts post both sides and only one side gets "outrage traction" but you see, its really both sides that are pushing political extremism and HELPING AMERICANS LOSE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM
(people lose faith in the system = less involvement and self-education and basically the sociology equivalent of depression, IANADoctor)
...more than 5 emoji in bio, sorry tweens
...usa flag emoji in uname and\or bio
...sentiment anal finds political text in 97+ percent of a user tweets from the last eight monthes

a user has 4 points they get flagged as a shitstirrer and are then can be considered for manual review to see if he\she seems like a bot [private list]
a user has 7 points they are considered a troll and get added to a public list
a user had 9 points that's the *take action!!* threshold and this info is actively pushed for review\accnt delete\investivative journalism\public shame- but not dox'ing
